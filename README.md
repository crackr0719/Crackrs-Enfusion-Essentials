## Character Weights T-Pose Template | ⚠️ IMPORTANT WORKFLOW NOTE

### Do **NOT** add the Armature Modifier until the very end

If the Armature Modifier is added too early:

- The **arms may fling upward**
- This **does not damage the mesh**
- This is **only a Blender-side visual issue**
- The model **works perfectly fine once imported into Enfusion**

### Correct Workflow Order

1. Align and edit your mesh in the T-pose  
2. Transfer and refine weights  
3. Fix deformation issues (armpits, shoulders, sleeves, etc.)  
4. **Add the Armature Modifier LAST**  
5. Export for Enfusion  

> The arm flinging looks scary, but it does **not** break anything.
